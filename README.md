# templates/spa

This template leverages [Remix SPA Mode](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/spa-mode) and the [Remix Vite Plugin](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) to build your app as a Single-Page Application using [Client Data](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/client-data) for all of your data loads and mutations.

## Setup


## Running Application

Run the repo in dev mode using the following command:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Production

When you are ready to build a production version of your app, `npm run build` will generate your assets and an `index.html` for the SPA.

```shellscript
npm run build
```

### Preview

You can preview the build locally with [vite preview](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli#vite-preview) to serve all routes via the single `index.html` file:

```shellscript
npm run preview
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `vite preview` is not designed for use as a production server
